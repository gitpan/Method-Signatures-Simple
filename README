Method-Signatures-Simple

RATIONALE

This module provides a basic C<method> keyword with simple signatures. It's intentionally simple,
and is supposed to be a stepping stone for its bigger brothers L<MooseX::Method::Signatures> and L<Method::Signatures>.
It only has a small benefit over regular subs, so if you want more features, look at those modules.
But if you're looking for a small amount of syntactic sugar, this might just be enough.

SYNOPSIS

    use Method::Signatures::Simple;

    method foo { $self->bar }

    # with signature
    method foo($bar, %opts) {
        $self->bar(reverse $bar) if $opts{rev};
    }

    # attributes
    method foo : lvalue { $self->{foo} }

    # change invocant name
    method foo ($class: $bar) { $class->bar($bar) }
